# Hotel Management Plugin - Refactored

This project has been successfully refactored from a monolithic JavaScript React application to a modern TypeScript-based architecture with improved code organization and maintainability.

## What's Changed

### 🔧 Technology Stack Updates
- **TypeScript**: Migrated from JavaScript to TypeScript for better type safety and developer experience
- **DND Kit**: Replaced `react-beautiful-dnd` with `@dnd-kit/core` for better performance and modern drag-and-drop functionality
- **State Management**: Introduced Zustand for predictable state management
- **Code Splitting**: Broke down the large `adminTruskavetsk.js` (1685 lines) into smaller, focused components
- **Date Pickers**: Updated to modern MUI X Date Pickers with date-fns v3 compatibility

### 🎯 Key Improvements

1. **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript support with comprehensive type definitions
2. **Better State Management**: Centralized state using Zustand with proper typing
3. **Component Reusability**: Extracted shared components and styled components
4. **Modern Drag & Drop**: Replaced deprecated `react-beautiful-dnd` with `@dnd-kit`
5. **Custom Hooks**: Encapsulated common functionality in reusable hooks
6. **Better Error Handling**: Improved error boundaries and validation
7. **Performance**: Optimized bundle size and loading performance
8. **Complete Functionality**: All tabs now have full CRUD operations for tariffs and seasons

### 🏗️ Architecture Benefits

- **Maintainability**: Smaller, focused components are easier to maintain
- **Testability**: Isolated components and hooks are easier to unit test
- **Scalability**: Modular architecture supports feature growth
- **Developer Experience**: TypeScript provides better IDE support and catch errors at compile time

### 📦 Dependencies

#### Added:
- `@dnd-kit/core`, `@dnd-kit/sortable`, `@dnd-kit/utilities` - Modern drag and drop
- `@mui/x-date-pickers` - Modern date picker components
- `zustand` - Lightweight state management
- `date-fns@^3.0.0` - Updated for compatibility

#### Removed:
- `react-beautiful-dnd` - Replaced with DND Kit

### 🚀 Build & Development

```bash
# Install dependencies
pnpm install

# Development mode
pnpm dev

# Build for production
pnpm build

# Type checking
pnpm type-check

# Linting
pnpm lint
```

### ✅ **Completed Features**

All tabs are now fully functional:

1. **📋 Номера (Rooms)**: Complete room management with drag & drop, media uploads, rich text editing
2. **💰 Тарифы (Tariffs)**: Full CRUD operations for tariff management with rich text descriptions
3. **🗓️ Сезоны (Seasons)**: Complete season management with date pickers and period management
4. **💵 Панель цен (Price Panel)**: Comprehensive pricing matrix for all rooms, tariffs, and seasons

### 📝 Migration Notes

The old files have been backed up with `.backup` extensions:
- `src/adminTruskavetsk.js.backup`
- `src/utils.js.backup`
- `src/components/Rooms.js.backup`
- `src/components/RoomsPanel.js.backup`

### 🔮 Future Enhancements

1. Add comprehensive unit tests with Jest and React Testing Library
2. Implement form validation with libraries like Yup or Zod
3. Add internationalization (i18n) support
4. Implement data persistence with React Query for server state
5. Add accessibility improvements (ARIA labels, keyboard navigation)
6. Implement lazy loading for better performance

### 🐛 Known Issues

- Some peer dependency warnings for `mui-rte` (needs React 17, but we're using React 18)
- WordPress media uploader type definitions could be improved

### 🤝 Contributing

When adding new features:
1. Follow the established TypeScript patterns
2. Use the Zustand store for global state
3. Create reusable components in the `shared` directory
4. Add proper type definitions in `types/index.ts`
5. Use custom hooks for complex logic
