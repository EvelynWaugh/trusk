# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves creating a WordPress plugin for managing hotel information as metabox in posts, including rooms and other relevant details. The metabox will be built using React and Material UI components, with pnpm as the package manager. This will provide hotel administrators with an intuitive interface to manage their property details directly from the WordPress admin panel. I already have files, just refine them, they maybe outdated. You can find them in /src
